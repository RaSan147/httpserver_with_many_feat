Server side requirement
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Python 3.7 or higher. Older support available.[^1]
* Basic knowledge about Python
* `send2trash`, `natsort` pip package (if missing, will be auto installed when the code runs)

[^1]: [3.4 compat](https://github.com/RaSan147/py_httpserver_Ult/blob/main/src/local_server%20(py%7E3.4).py) version to support till 3.4, but will not maintain that often. Also not recommended since it got EOL)


Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download the `local_server.py`
2. yes, only the `local_server.py`. Other files are not necessary.
3. Install Python 3.7 or higher and run the `local_server.py`
4. The server will show your ip and port, use that with and local device browser under the same network
   * Like this `192.168.0.100:6969/`

### On Linux (Optional)
To run code directly like a script on a linux machine. Just paste these lines on a terminal.
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaSan147/py_httpserver_Ult/main/local_server.py -O # download script and replace old version
chmod +x local_server.py # give permissions
./local_server.py # run like a script
```

# Customization
1. Simply running the code will create a server on `D:\ Drive` for windows on `Port: 6969`
1. On browser (same device as server), go to `localhost:port_number` to see the output
1. To change the server running directory, 
   - i) either edit the code  
   - ii) or add `-d` or `--directory` command line argument when launching the program
        - `local_server.py -d .` to launch the server in current directory (where the file is)
        - `local_server.py -d "D:\Server\Public folder\"`  (Use Double-Quotation while directory has space)
        - `local_server.py -d "D:/Server/Public folder"` (Forward or backward slash really doesn't matter, unless your terminal thinks otherwise)
 1. To change port number
    - i) just edit the code for permanent change  
    - ii) or add the port number at the end of the command line arg  
       -  `local_server.py 45678`
       -  `local_server.py -d . 45678`

1. To specify alternate bind address
    - Add bind add `-bind {address}`

# FAQ:
<details>
  <summary>Using WSL, "PIP not found"</summary>
  
  Run this to install `pip3` and add `pip` to path
  ```
  sudo apt -y purge python3-pip
  sudo python3 -m pip uninstall pip
  sudo apt -y install python3-pip
  pip install --upgrade pip
  echo "export PATH=\"${HOME}/.local/bin:$PATH\"" >>"${HOME}"/.bashrc
  ```
  Re-running the file should work.

<details>
  <summary>USE "local_server" like command "youtube_dl"</summary>
  
  **Unfortunately this is not possible yet**, I'll make sure this feature works when publish it in `PyPI pip`

  <summary>Deleted (Move to Recycle), But WHERE ARE THEY?? [on LINUX & WSL]</summary>
  
  Actually the feature is working fine, unfortunately NO-GUI mode linux and WSL don't recycle bin, so you can't find it!
  And to make things worse, **you need to manually clear the recyle bin** from `~/.local/share/Trash`
  
  **SO I'D RECOMMAND USING DELETE PARMANENTLY**
