How to use
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Simply running the code will create a server on `G:\ Drive` for windows on `Port: 6969`

1. To change the server running directory, 
   - i) either edit the code  
   - ii) or add `-d` or -`--directory` command line argument when launching the program
        - `local_server.py -d .` to launch the server in current directory (where the file is)
        - `local_server.py -d "D:\Server\Public folder\`  (Use Double-Quotation while directory has space)
        - `local_server.py -d "D:/Server/Public folder` (Forward or backward slash really doesn't matter)
 1. To change port number
    - i) just edit the code for permanent change  
    - ii) or add the port number at the end of the command line arg  
       -  `local_server.py 45678`
       -  `local_server.py -d . 45678`
