Server side requirement
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Python 3.7 or higher [^1]
* Basic knowledge about Python
* `send2trash` pip package (will be auto installed when the code runs)
* (for windows) no need to download 7z[^2] (from here), it will be automatically downloaded

[^1]: Making a working version to support till 3.4, but not sure will maintain that. Also not recommended since it got EOL)
[^2]: Planning to drop using 7z and use Python `zipfile`

Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download the `local_server.py`
2. yes, only the `local_Server.py`. Other files are not necessary.
3. Install Python 3.7 or higher and run the `local_server.py`
4. The server will show your ip and port, use that with and local device browser under the same network
   * Like this `192.168.0.100:6969/`
# On Linux

On Linux give permissions by :
```
$sudo chmod +x local_server.py
```
run like a script with :
```
$./local_server.py
```

   


Customization
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Simply running the code will create a server on `G:\ Drive` for windows on `Port: 6969`
1. On browser (same device as server), go to `localhost:port_number` to see the output
1. To change the server running directory, 
   - i) either edit the code  
   - ii) or add `-d` or `--directory` command line argument when launching the program
        - `local_server.py -d .` to launch the server in current directory (where the file is)
        - `local_server.py -d "D:\Server\Public folder\"`  (Use Double-Quotation while directory has space)
        - `local_server.py -d "D:/Server/Public folder"` (Forward or backward slash really doesn't matter, unless your terminal thinks otherwise)
 1. To change port number
    - i) just edit the code for permanent change  
    - ii) or add the port number at the end of the command line arg  
       -  `local_server.py 45678`
       -  `local_server.py -d . 45678`

1. To specify alternate bind address
    - Add bind add `-bind {address}`
