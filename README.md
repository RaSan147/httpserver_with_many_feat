Server side requirement
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Python 3.7 or higher. Older support available.[^1]
* Basic knowledge about Python
* `send2trash`, `natsort` pip package (if missing, will be auto installed when the code runs)

[^1]: [3.4 compat](/src/local_server%20(py%7E3.4).py) version to support till 3.4, but will not maintain that often. Also not recommended since it got EOL)


# Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------
  * **Install Python 3.7 or higher**
  ### On Windows
  1. Download the `local_server.py`. Yes, only the `local_server.py`. Other files are not necessary.
  2. Or Use This Script on terminal where you want to save it.
```
curl -O local_server.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaSan147/py_httpserver_Ult/main/local_server.py # download script and replace old version
.\local_server.py # run like a script
```
  3. The server will show your ip and port, use that with and local device browser under the same network
     * Like this `192.168.0.100:6969/`

  ### On Linux
  To run code directly like a script on a linux machine. Just paste these lines on a terminal.
  ```
  curl -O local_server.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaSan147/py_httpserver_Ult/main/local_server.py # download script and replace old version
  chmod +x local_server.py # give permissions
  ./local_server.py # run like a script
  ```
CHECK [FAQ](#faq) FOR FUTURE HELP AND ISSUE FIX


# Customization
1. Simply running the code on `Windows` will create a server on `D:\ Drive`on `Port: 6969`
1. On browser (same device as server), go to `deviceIP:port_number` to see the output
1. To change the server running directory, 
   - i) either edit the code  (see `config` class at top)
   - ii) or add `-d` or `--directory` command line argument when launching the program
        - `local_server.py -d .` to launch the server in current directory (where the file is)
        - `local_server.py -d "D:\Server\Public folder\"`  (Use Double-Quotation while directory has space)
        - `local_server.py -d "D:/Server/Public folder"` (Forward or backward slash really doesn't matter, unless your terminal thinks otherwise)
 1. To change port number
    - i) just edit the code for permanent change  (see `config` class at top)
    - ii) or add the port number at the end of the command line arg  
       -  `local_server.py 45678`
       -  `local_server.py -d . 45678`

1. To specify alternate bind address
    - Add bind add `-bind {address}` # idk if it works

 TODO:
--------------------------------------------------------------

* https://github.com/RaSan147/py_httpserver_Ult/issues/33 Show thumbnails, for png and jpg (how to do with just standard library?), For others, just show extension.
* https://github.com/RaSan147/py_httpserver_Ult/issues/34 Copy stream URL for videos to play with any video player
* https://github.com/RaSan147/py_httpserver_Ult/issues/36 Add side bar to do something ü§î
* check output ip and port accuracy on multiple os  
* https://github.com/RaSan147/py_httpserver_Ult/issues/37 Backup code if Reload causes unhandled issue and can't be accessed
* https://github.com/RaSan147/py_httpserver_Ult/issues/38 command line arg for passwords (vulnerable on reload)
* https://github.com/RaSan147/py_httpserver_Ult/issues/39 User login and user based permission set. üîë

  <summary>Using WSL, "PIP not found"</summary>
 
  > Run this to install `pip3` and add `pip` to path 
  ```
  sudo apt -y purge python3-pip
  sudo python3 -m pip uninstall pip
  sudo apt -y install python3-pip
  pip install --upgrade pip
  echo "export PATH=\"${HOME}/.local/bin:$PATH\"" >>"${HOME}"/.bashrc

  <summary>USE "local_server" like command "youtube_dl"</summary>
  
  > **Unfortunately this is not possible yet**, I'll make sure this feature works when publish it in `PyPI pip`
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Deleted (Move to Recycle), But WHERE ARE THEY?? [on LINUX & WSL]</summary>
  
  > Actually the feature is working fine, unfortunately NO-GUI mode linux and WSL don't recycle bin, so you can't find it!
  > And to make things worse, **you need to manually clear the recyle bin** from `~/.local/share/Trash`
  > **SO I'D RECOMMAND USING DELETE PARMANENTLY**
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Running on WINDOWS, but can't access with other device</summary>
 
  > You probably have **FireWall ON** and Unconfigured.
  > For your safety, I'd recommand you to allow Python on private network and run the server when your network is Private.
  > IN SHORT: ALLOW PYTHON ON FIREWALL, RUN THE SERVER
 
  > *note: allowed on private but using public network on firewall will cause similar issue, you gotta make both same or allow python both on public and private*
